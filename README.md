### Many thanks and enjoy this simplistic view of the programs that i will be covering throughout the course of my development.

I used simple HTML and CSS to manipulate position, size and visual display of the items on each page,
including nav points using lists and a mix of inline-block and block elements for positioning.

Finally i used the CLI to push the project across and make adjustments as and when necessary.
